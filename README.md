# Data-science-analysis-Trees-and-Accomodations-prices-in-Paris
This project goal was to asses the relationship between trees locations and accommodation prices in Paris urban landscape. 

Here you can see the 2 datasets I used, and the python notebook. The python notebook beig to heavy, github won't show the preview. You need to download it and run it in Google Colab to make it work.

You also have access to a dissertation on biases of this study, and the presentation slide I made for the project.
